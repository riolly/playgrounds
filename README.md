# BelovedOne ❤️

## Why this app exists

In the past, my girlfriend and I found ourselves in financial debt. This challenge pushed us to learn about **finance** and **time management**. Throughout our journey to fix our finances, we realized the need for a tool that could help us manage our money efficiently, keeping us accountable and reminding us of our daily and monthly expenses. That's when **this app** came into existence.

### Milestones and Goals

As time passed, we had to prepare for our wedding and save for it. Additionally, there were many other goals we wanted to achieve in our relationship, like:

- 💻 Buying a new laptop for my work
- 🏠 Saving for a future house
- ✈️ Travel to a new country
- ⛪ Charity through our church
- etc.

Through these experiences, we learned the importance of managing **money**, **time**, and **tasks**. The key to consistently managing all of those was **accountability** and **excitement**.

## Our Hope for You

We hope that this app will be helpful not only for us but also for you. By ourseleves, we are not strong enough, but together your BelovedOne, nothing is impossible.

**Berto & Nike**
